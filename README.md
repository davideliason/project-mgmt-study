Objective

This app is an exercise in building a React app the 'right way', by following the recipe suggested by the Redux team in the article "Usage With React". That, in turn, references an article by the React team in the article "Thinking In React." 

Steps Taken

First, started with a mockup, then broke the UI into a component hierarchy. With the React team's suggestion of building a non-state, non-dynamic app first, I then built out a version that used only props.

At this point, I determined that I could have a Firebase database containing all of the values used by the app, hydrate the redux store, and boom, that would be the extent as, for this version, there wouldn't be any user-added content or authentication.



The Result
